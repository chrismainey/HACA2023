# HACA 2023 - 11.10.23  Day 1

## Peter Spillsbury
Pull the last part of Peter Spillsbury's talk:

...the right data is useless if it addresses the wrong question.
...The right answer to a question is not useful if it doesn't have a clear decision making process.
It's important to distinguish between data management, BI and reporting, and analysis.

## Ben Goldacre

OpenSafely has a permanent basis for covid work and working on wider.  Ming is now supporting it? What does that mean? 
Supported the idea that you need a mixture of all of your skills sets across a team including the communications, tech skills.

Check slides:
+ Reduce places data are collected store and dissemination
+ Make data accessible
+ Upskill
+ Legislation put in place to stop monopolisation of data
+ Legislation put in place to aid meaningful accountability
+ Standardised methods and approaches


### Suggestions:
1. __Avoid dissemination:__ use TREs+ - Pseudominisation is not sufficient to protect records.  See his slides for example on Tony Blair.  Use example of his wife.  Two babies in known yeas, move from Bath to London to Oxford.  Sufficient to find her record.  IG is next line of defence: so slow, quite arbitrary and not enough to do this.
2. __Modern, Open Working methods:__ RAP and open coding. Take slides and show comparison
3. __Data curation and knowledge managemet:__ at risk of being neglected. Do once for all
4. __NHS Analyst workforce__ create workforce model, open coding, RAP and training, expert help from academia and industry but done openly, train senior non-analysts and leaders on hoe to be good customers of data teams.

## Ming Tang

Start of the journey, won't get it all right, need us all to be vocal and tell us what you need.
Data saves lives roadmap.  Move to personalised, precision medicine, keen to move to the real-time analytics flows.  Haven't moved on in things like risk-strat an predictive analytics because the changes to the NHS have sent things backwards.  Social determinant of health is a key element for future analytics. How do we make the case for health and well-being and investment in keeping health v.s. acute need.

Data adoption in the NHS is difficult.  We are set in our ways as a profession.  We want to be a group that can transition to a new unified way of working. Pushed the idea of working on a platform and 
Digital standards academy  slide is worth including.  Supported the use of the apprenticeship levy to build the workforce and training. Recognised the idea of experiential tacit skills.  Want to develop skill sets around data science and engineering, and should training them up.  - Linked in to the competency framework.

Stressed the slower pace of change for a large system than individual changes.  Need to build a strong data foundation, and can piggy-back off the digital transformation elements too.

## Prof. Dame Sue Hill - CSO genomics

Improving outcomes through personalised medicine report.
This is an element that is coming in, and not well represented to do this at present.  Will be funding an AI and machine learning centre of excellence.




## HUgo Herea 0 Inequalitys throuhg machine learning

Cancer focussed, delays in pathways assumed to be related to inequalities. Simple clustering approach, tried several algorithm. Used Age, gender, location, diagnosis (cancer no).  Looks interesting, as sub-group analysis then interpreted. The radial plots for the deprivation element was really interesting and helped a lot, particularly given the confounding element.
Get in touch?  Clustering related to likelihood of breaching 28 day target.  T1N0M0 was 62% more likely to breach the 28 target.  How many people did that refer to (effect size)?

## Alex Royn - Deputy director analytics sufflok and norfolos 
10 year demand and capacity forecasting.

Focussing on older, rural population, deprivation, seaside-based community. Growing and ageing population.  Build: do nothing, realistic (known service change), radical (with potential transformation).  Started with primary care model and how demand for GP appointment will change with that, capturing unmet demand, calculated propensity to consult, time taken and referral into secondary care.  24%-40% growth expected, then compared to workforce demand model.  Made the 'radical' model about digital first elements.  

### Higo herea - same as last talk - acute element
System dynamics model.  Represented queues in buckets and how people moved from one to the next.
historical RTT model was then projected forwards.  Looks good, can we get him to share this with out team?  

## Sam connected with suffolk social care 
Advantage of ICS modelling approach. Used time series forecast using Prophet.  Makes sense.

## Sam Brieley - User-centred approaches to designing reporting tools -SCW
If you want to understand what you users want, then you can't assume that yourself.
Based on design thinking. Frame the problem -> understand the context -> design solutions for it.  Team includes user researchers, analysts, deliver team and designer.

System and regional leadership teams often struggle to articulate their needs for performance data  + Existing performance reposting approaches and products don't always meet their users' needs.
Taken interviews with users , analyst and others.  Identified a bunch of common things across settings.

##  Anna Ramond - THF
Projecting patterns of long-term illness in the population of England to 204 - get the report when
it comes not next week.  Code is already up on his github page.  Post-modelling stuff isn't up yet.

## Case-mix adjustment in resource allocation
Principles: Calculation reflects need, address known limitations of Carr-Hill (ecological fallacy), that is objectively fair.  Principles: use patient level data, use local practises own data, comprehensive and contemporary, use diagnosis not activity. Use diagnosis, not activity to assess need.
__If no diagnosis?__  Activity reinforces current use of system.

Sort of creating a longitudinal panel dataset based on patients  __is it a panel dataset?__ 
__Do you fctor clustering in?__
Recognised data quality and recording issue. Talks about imputing the missing data/removing some of the distortion of the case mixing.

__Causal loop?__
